Doing mobile development on a Mac?  Need to show your mobile device using your USB camera during a presentation?

Here's a quick utility that I hacked together over the weekend to do just that.  Supports mirroring/reversed images (which is why PhotoBooth won't work for this) and borderless mode to keep it in the foreground over an IDE or presentation.  Hope you find it useful!
