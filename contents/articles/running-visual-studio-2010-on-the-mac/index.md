Following a few recent presentations, I&#39;ve had a couple of people ask how I run Visual Studio on the Mac. 

You&#39;ll be sad to hear that I don&#39;t have a special version of Visual Studio for Mac OSX - instead I am using VMWare Fusion 3.1 to run a copy of Windows 7 in a virtual machine. Fusion has a mode called &quot;Unity&quot; which allows windows from the virtual machine to interact with windows on the host operating system (even to the point where I can put icons for Windows-based applications in the dock on the Mac). There is a little performance hit running applications in this way vs. a full screen virtual machine, but it&#39;s certainly useful for presentations where you are flipping between both environments.
