Thanks to everyone that came to my session at TechEd 2011 yesterday - it was a great crowd, and the presentation was a lot of fun to put together. My apologies for any confusion with the title (i.e. not making it explicit that it was a developer talk in the title) - this will definitely be something that we address next time. 

You can find the slides from the talk below, and the source code of all demos can be found on [GitHub](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simonguest). Hope you enjoy, and look forward to any feedback.

*** Update - corrected Session code in title ***
