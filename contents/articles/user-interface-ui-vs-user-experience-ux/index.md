I often get asked the difference between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX). Although the original intent and definition of UI started out in the right direction, too many times I&#39;ve heard it used to explain just the visual aspects (or cool factor) of an interface.&amp;nbsp; To give you a non-technology related example, let me show you the hotel room that I recently stayed at in Dublin.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The hotel is&amp;nbsp;one of the more boutique, modern style ones that we see in large cities (imagine Morcheeba playing in the lobby, contrasting black and white furniture&amp;nbsp;etc. - you get the idea).

As I got to my room late at night, I of course wanted to switch on the lights.&amp;nbsp; In front of me (in semi-darkness)&amp;nbsp;I found&amp;nbsp;the panel for the lights:

As you can see, on first glance, a relatively nice&amp;nbsp;looking &quot;interface&quot; (stainless steel finish, clean, elegant etc.).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;experience however was a different story.&amp;nbsp; Firstly, there&amp;nbsp;is no indication&amp;nbsp;of what each switch does.&amp;nbsp; After playing around for a minute, I was able to work out that&amp;nbsp;the left dial is for the main lights, the right dial is for the bathroom lights, the main switch seems to be like a master switch for both.&amp;nbsp; Seems simple enough, however you can also push the dials to turn them on&#x2F;off individually, with no feedback or indication of what state they are in.&amp;nbsp; To add more confusion, there is a 3 second delay after pushing the dial before the lights come on.&amp;nbsp; Of course, what happens is the following:&amp;nbsp; Hit the master switch - nothing happens.&amp;nbsp; Turn the dial - nothing happens.&amp;nbsp; Push the dial, nothing happens.&amp;nbsp; Push the dial again (within 3 seconds of pushing the dial last time).&amp;nbsp; Nothing happens.&amp;nbsp; Hit the master switch again - nothing happens.&amp;nbsp; Sigh.&amp;nbsp; Repeat.

Once I did get the lights working in the bathroom,&amp;nbsp;I came across the following sink:

Again, very nice looking - a&amp;nbsp;modern, open design with elegant lines and faucets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Question for you: How do I release the water in the bowl?&amp;nbsp; Looking around the basin, there is no stopper for the plug, no chain, no indication of how to release the plug.&amp;nbsp; Also, notice how the plug is flat to the surface of the bowl - there is no affordance&amp;nbsp;indicating that it might be possible to push or pull the plug in any way to release the water.&amp;nbsp; The answer?

Ah, of course - who wouldn&#39;t have thought about tipping the plug 45&#39; to the left and having it swivel in the middle?&amp;nbsp; Sigh (again).&amp;nbsp; Having been humiliated with the sink, I thought I would take a shower instead.&amp;nbsp; I was greeted with this shower head.&amp;nbsp;

Again, the pencil design looks very elegant, and unique - but just try moving the direction of the shower head when the water is running.&amp;nbsp; Impossible.&amp;nbsp; Because of the slim design and texture, you can&#39;t redirect the shower head in any direction (which can be annoying if it&#39;s aiming toward the door as you get in).&amp;nbsp; Also, the design results in a powerful, but very directed spray of water - certainly refreshing, but not as comfortable as you may like.

The difference between&amp;nbsp;&quot;cool&amp;nbsp;looking UI&quot;&amp;nbsp;and UX?&amp;nbsp; You could argue that the items in the hotel room look as if they have a great design, but ultimately&amp;nbsp;result in&amp;nbsp;a poor user experience.&amp;nbsp;I like unique&amp;nbsp;designs - but don&#39;t let this come at the expense of a frustrating experience.&amp;nbsp; I just hope we don&#39;t see the same thing with new UI technologies.&amp;nbsp; There are a lot of new UI advances that can create&amp;nbsp;unique looking interfaces, but without an understanding of true user experience, it&#39;s going to be as bad as my hotel room...
